.............<< CONSTRUCTOR >>..................

> CONSTRUCTORS ARE SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION WITH THE SAME NAME AS OF 
  THE CLASS USED TO INITIALIZE THE VARIABLES OF THE CLASS.

> IN DART THE COMPILER MAKES A DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR, IN CASE THE USER 
  DOESN'T.

> CONSTRUCTOR DOESN'T RETURN A VALUE.

> THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF CONSTRUCTOR 
    1. DEFAULLT CONSTRUCTOR - THESE ARE MADE AUTOMATICALLY BY THE DART 
       COMPILER AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY PARAMETERS.
    2. PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR - THESE ARE CONSTRUCTORS WHICH CONTAINS 
       SOME PARAMETES INSIDE IT.
    3. NAMED CONSTRUCTOR - As you canâ€™t define multiple constructors with the same name, 
       this type of constructor is the solution to the problem.They allow
       the user to make multiple constructors with a different name.
       EG :- ClassName.DEFAULT();
             ClassName.NAMED();
             ClassName.PARAMETERIZED(String x, int y){
                 print();
             }

> SYNTAX: 

    void main(){
        var a = new ClassName("Peter",30);
    }
    class ClassName({
        ClassName(String s, int n){
            print("name is $s");
            print("age is $n" );
        }

    }
