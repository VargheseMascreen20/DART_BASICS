..................<< EXCEPTION >>..................
> EXCEPTIONS ARE UNWANTED CONDITIONS THAT AFFECTS THE 
  NORMAL FLOW OF THE PROGRAM.
> DART EXCEPTION = RUNTIME ERRORS - ERRORS ARISING DURING 
  THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM. 
> IF THE PROGRAM DOES NOT RETURN AN ERROR DURING THE COMPILE TIME &
  THE PROGRAM RUNS INTERNALLY AND THE COMPILER RETURNS AN
  INAPPROPRIATE CONDITION ,THIS IS CALLED DART EXCEPTION.
> WE USE EXCEPTION HANDLING TO HANDLE THE RUNTIME ERRORS.
> THE BUILD IN DART EXECPTIONS ARE :-
    
    1.DEFFERED LOAD EXCEPTION - CANNOT LOAD A DEFAULT LIBRARY.
    
    2.FORMAT EXCEPTION - ENTERING WRONG VALUE EG:- ENTERING INT VALUE 
                         WHEN ASKED TO ENTER STRING.
    
    3.INTEGER DIVISION BY ZERO - TRYING TO DIVIDE A NUMBER BY ZERO.

    4.IOEXCEPTION - BASE CLASS FOR ALL IO EXCEPTIONS.

    5.ISOLATESPAWN EXCEPTION - CANNOT CREATE AN ISOLATE. 
                     isolate - An isolate is what all Dart code runs in. It's 
                               like a little space on the machine with its own, 
                               private chunk of memory and a single thread running
                               an event loop. An isolate has its own memory and 
                               a single thread of execution that runs an event loop.

    6.TIME OUT EXCEPTION - SCHEDULED TIMEOUT HAPPENS WHILE WAITING FOR AN ASYNCHRONOUS RESULT.
